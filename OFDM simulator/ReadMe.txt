##### Code updates
June 21th 2021:

This design has been obtained by making additions on a ready-made code.

Runsim_2.m and waterfilling.m files have been added to the existing codes.

Updated files are rx_estimate_channel.m, rx_gen_chan_amps.m, receiver.m, single_packet.m, and runsim.m .

##### Programme 
The simulator GUI is started with command 'ui_start' in Matlab command window.

WLAN simulation starts by clicking the 'Start Simulation' button in the GUI window.

WLAN simulation can be terminated, before set number of packets have been reached by pressing 'control-C'.
